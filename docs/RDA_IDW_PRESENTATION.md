## Slide 3: The Challenge
**Why MaLDReTH II?**

### The Problem
- **Fragmented Landscape:** 1000+ research data tools exist
- **Poor Discoverability:** Researchers struggle to find appropriate tools
- **Limited Interoperability:** Tools don't communicate well
- **No Unified View:** Missing comprehensive mapping of tool interactions

### The Impact
> *"Researchers spend 30-40% of their time finding and configuring tools instead of doing research"*

### Our Response
**Systematic mapping of digital research infrastructure across the entire data lifecycle**

---

## Slide 4: MaLDReTH II Overview
**Mapping the Landscape of Digital Research Tools Harmonised**

### RDA Working Group Initiative
- **Launch:** 2023 (Building on MaLDReTH I)
- **Members:** 45+ institutions globally
- **Focus:** Tool discovery, categorization, and interoperability

### Key Deliverables
1. **12-Stage Lifecycle Model** ✅ Complete
2. **Tool Categorization Framework** ✅ Complete
3. **PRISM Platform** ✅ Beta (Today's focus!)
4. **Open Access Database** 🔄 In Progress
5. **Community Guidelines** 🔄 In Progress

## Slide 5: The 12-Stage Research Data Lifecycle
**MaLDReTH Model**

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│CONCEPTUALISE│    PLAN     │    FUND     │   COLLECT   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│   PROCESS   │   ANALYSE   │    STORE    │   PUBLISH   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  PRESERVE   │    SHARE    │   ACCESS    │  TRANSFORM  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Why 12 stages?**
- Previous models: 6-8 stages (too coarse)
- MaLDReTH model: Granular enough for tool mapping
- Captures full data journey: conception → reuse

---

## Slide 6: Introducing PRISM

## Key Terminology

### MaLDReTH
**Full Expansion**: **M**apping the **L**andscape of **D**igital **Re**search **T**ools **H**armonised

**Definition**: The harmonised Research Data Lifecycle (RDL) model created by the RDA-OfR Working Group to serve as the foundational framework for categorising and characterising various types of digital research tools.

**Purpose**: To provide a common language and reference point for researchers, data stewards, and tool developers alike, facilitating collaboration and interoperability within the research data ecosystem.

### Research Data Lifecycle (RDL)

**Definition**: The complete journey of research data from initial concept through to reuse and transformation, represented in the MaLDReTH model as 12 distinct stages.

**Context**: "As there is not one accepted universal Research Data Lifecycle (RDL) model, the first deliverable by the RDA-OfR Mapping the Landscape of Digital Research Tools Working Group (WG) involved the creation of a harmonised RDL that could be used as the foundational framework for underpinning later work on the categorisation and characterisation of digital research tools."

**Methodology**: Created through:
1. Landscape review of 20 candidate RDL models
2. Qualitative analysis to select top 5 models (DCC, RDMkit, EMBL-ABR, RDaF, UCL)
3. Semantic distance methodology over etymological/taxonomic net to align stages
4. Harmonisation into 12-stage MaLDReTH model

### Digital Research Tools

**Definition**: Software, platforms, services, and systems used to support research activities across the research data lifecycle.

**Context**: The WG aimed to "identify, categorise, and map different types of digital research tools to the 12 stages of the MaLDReTH RDL model."

**Note**: The working group omitted the FUND stage from tool categorisation "since the examples identified were not categorised as digital research tools."

### Tool Category

**Definition**: A classification group for similar tools within a lifecycle stage, identified based on consensus and well-known terminologies.

**Implementation**: "A maximum of three tool categories were identified for each RDL stage and a short description was provided for each tool category."

**Verification Status**: VERIFIED
**Verified Date**: 2025-10-02

---

### Exemplar Tool / Representative Example Tool

**Definition**: An individual digital research tool that serves as a representative example for a specific tool category. Tools that are commonly used to perform tasks during a specific stage of the RDL.

**Implementation**: "During the final phase, the subgroup identified a maximum of three individual digital research tools that serve as representative examples for each tool category."

## The 12 Stages of the MaLDReTH Research Data Lifecycle

### 1. CONCEPTUALISE

**Official Definition**: To formulate the initial research idea or hypothesis, and define the scope of the research project and the data component/requirements of that project.

**Source**: RDA-OfR Mapping the Landscape of Digital Research Tools WG Deliverable 1, Page 8
**Verification Status**: VERIFIED
**Verified Date**: 2025-10-02

---

### 2. PLAN

**Official Definition**: To establish a structured strategic framework for management of the research project, outlining aims, objectives, methodologies, and resources required for data collection, management and analysis. Data management plans (DMP) should be established for this phase of the lifecycle.

**Verification Status**: VERIFIED
**Verified Date**: 2025-10-02

### 4. COLLECT

**Official Definition**: To use predefined procedures, methodologies and instruments to acquire and store data that is reliable, fit for purpose and of sufficient quality to test the research hypothesis.

**Number of Tools Identified**: 48 representative tools

**Source**: RDA-OfR Mapping the Landscape of Digital Research Tools WG Deliverable 1, Page 8
**Verification Status**: VERIFIED
**Verified Date**: 2025-10-02

---

### 5. PROCESS

**Official Definition**: To make new and existing data analysis-ready. This may involve standardised pre-processing, cleaning, reformatting, structuring, filtering, and performing quality control checks on data. It may also involve the creation and definition of metadata for use during analysis, such as acquiring provenance from instruments and tools used during data collection.

**Number of Tools Identified**: 38 representative tools

### 6. ANALYSE

**Official Definition**: To derive insights, knowledge, and understanding from processed data. Data analysis involves iterative exploration and interpretation of experimental or computational results, often utilising mathematical models and formulae to investigate relationships between experimental variables. Distinct data analysis techniques and methodologies are applied according to the data type (quantitative vs qualitative).

**Number of Tools Identified**: 10 representative tools

### 9. PRESERVE

**Official Definition**: To ensure the safety, integrity, and accessibility of data for as long as necessary so that data is as FAIR as possible. Data preservation is more than data storage and backup, since data can be stored and backed up without being preserved. Preservation should include curation activities such as data cleaning, validation, assigning preservation metadata, assigning representation information, and ensuring acceptable data structures and file formats. At a minimum, data and associated metadata should be published in a trustworthy digital repository and clearly cited in the accompanying journal article unless this is not possible (e.g. due to the privacy or safety concerns).

**Number of Tools Identified**: 11 representative tools

**Official Definition**: To make data available and accessible to humans and/or machines. Data may be shared with project collaborators or published to share it with the wider research community and society at large. Data sharing is not limited to open data or public data, and can be done during various stages of the research data lifecycle. At a minimum, data and associated metadata should be published in a trustworthy digital repository and clearly cited in the accompanying journal article.

## Important Notes on the Lifecycle Model

### Iterative Nature

The lifecycle includes a note that **"COLLECT > PROCESS > ANALYSE > STORE may be a repeating cycle"**, acknowledging the iterative nature of research data work.

### Model Basis

The MaLDReTH model was created by harmonising 5 selected RDL models:
1. **DCC Data Curation Lifecycle** (Digital Data Curation Centre) - Focused on curation, workflow, data management centric
2. **RDMkit Data Life Cycle** (ELIXIR) - Popular, well known, simple, uses commonly referenced stages
3. **Best Practice Data Life Cycle Approaches for the Life Sciences** (EMBL-ABR) - Best practice RDL for researchers in Life Sciences/Bioinformatics
4. **Research Data Framework (RDaF)** (NIST) - Broad, discipline agnostic
5. **The Research Data Lifecycle** (UCL) - Comprehensive, uses commonly referenced stages, useful references to activities

## Connection to GORC (Global Open Research Commons)

**Context**: "An overarching aim of this deliverable was to highlight the potential for and current limitations of streamlined flow of research data and metadata throughout the research data lifecycle based on how different types of research tools interoperate. Understanding this is highly valuable in the context of developing the national and international open research commons."

**Relationship**: The MaLDReTH work aimed to "contribute to and build on the work of the RDA's Global Open Research Commons IG and GORC International Model WG."

## Research Data Management (RDM) Context

**Definition**: "Research data management (RDM) is a critical aspect of modern scientific endeavours, ensuring the integrity, reproducibility, and long-term preservation of valuable research outputs."

**Challenge Addressed**: "The lack of a universally accepted RDL model poses challenges to establishing standardised practices and facilitating effective RDM across various research domains."

## 🎓 Pro Tips

2. **Use a second monitor:** Script/notes on one screen, PRISM on the other.

3. **Practice transitions:** Know exactly where you'll click before recording.

4. **Leave pauses:** 2-3 seconds of silence before/after important points. Easier to add transitions.

5. **Record B-roll:** After main recording, capture extra footage (close-ups, alternative angles, loading screens).

6. **Save project files:** Keep ScreenFlow projects for future edits or derivative content.

7. **Export masters:** Save a high-quality master (ProRes 422) before creating web versions.

8. **Backup everything:** Screencasts can be 10-50GB. Use external drive or cloud backup.

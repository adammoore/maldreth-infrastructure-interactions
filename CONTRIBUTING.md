## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
  * `feat:` New feature
  * `fix:` Bug fix
  * `docs:` Documentation only changes
  * `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  * `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  * `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Python Styleguide

All Python code must adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with the following additions:

* Use type hints where possible
* Maximum line length is 100 characters
* Use f-strings for string formatting
* Sort imports with `isort`
* Format code with `black`

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

from flask import Flask, request
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

from app.models import User


def get_users(status: Optional[str] = None) -> List[User]:
    """
    Get users with optional status filter.
    
    Args:
        status: Optional user status filter
        
    Returns:
        List of User objects
    """
    query = User.query
    if status:
        query = query.filter_by(status=status)
    return query.all()
```

### JavaScript Styleguide

* Use ES6+ features
* 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
* Use template literals for string interpolation

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for Python docstrings
* Keep README and other documentation up to date
* Include code examples where appropriate

We use pytest for testing. Please write tests for any new functionality:

```python
# test_example.py
def test_new_feature(client, sample_data):
    """Test the new feature works correctly."""
    response = client.get('/api/new-feature')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['status'] == 'success'
```
